We measured their eye movements and extracted information about saccades (4 different measures) and fixations (2 different measures).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please open it in Excel (or OpenOffice) and have a look. As you can see, it has tons of information about different participants. It starts out with summarized information that is gathered from the data below. Starting in row 112, the data that I am interested in, begins.\n",

This is by far the most powerful method!\n",
